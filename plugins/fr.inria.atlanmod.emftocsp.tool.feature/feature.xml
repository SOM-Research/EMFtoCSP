      EMFToCSP is a tool for the automatic verification of UML and
EMF models, 
annotated with OCL constraints. It can check automatically several
correctness 
properties such as the satisfiability of the model or the lack
of contradictory constraints

BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE
LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS
OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE
THE CONTENT.
Applicable Licenses
Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the
Eclipse Foundation is provided to you under the terms and conditions
of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;). A copy of
the EPL is provided with this Content and is also available at
http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html. For purposes of the
EPL, &quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.
Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object
code, documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse
Foundation source code repository (&quot;Repository&quot;) in software
modules (&quot;Modules&quot;) and made available as downloadable archives
(&quot;Downloads&quot;).
Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate
delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules
may include plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;), plug-in fragments (&quot;Fragments&quot;),
and features (&quot;Features&quot;). 
Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or
JAR (Javaâ„¢ ARchive) in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;. 
A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments
and associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory
in a directory named &quot;features&quot;. Within a Feature, files named
&quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version numbers
of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.
Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;).
Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list
of the names and version numbers of Included Features. 
The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should
be contained in files named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms
and conditions governing Features and Included Features should
be contained in files named &quot;license.html&quot; (&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;).
Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of
a Download or Module including, but not limited to the following
locations:
The top-level (root) directory 
Plug-in and Fragment directories 
Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs 
Sub-directories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of certain Plug-ins
Feature directories 
Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is
installed using the Provisioning Technology (as defined below),
you must agree to a license (&quot;Feature Update License&quot;) during
the installation process. If the Feature contains Included Features,
the Feature Update License should either provide you with the
terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform
you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be
found in the &quot;license&quot; property of files named &quot;feature.properties&quot;
found within a Feature. Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature
Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions (or references
to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the associated
Content in that directory.
THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY
REFER TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS
AND CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE
(BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):
Common Public License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html)
Apache Software License 1.1 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE)

Use of Provisioning Technology
The Eclipse Foundation makes available provisioning software,
examples of which include, but are not limited to, p2 and the
Eclipse Update Manager (&quot;Provisioning Technology&quot;) for the purpose
of allowing users to install software, documentation, information
and/or other materials (collectively &quot;Installable Software&quot;).
This capability is provided with the intent of allowing such
users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information
about packaging Installable Software is available at http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html
(&quot;Specification&quot;).
You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to
install Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling
the applicable license agreements relating to the Installable
Software to be presented to, and accepted by, the users of the
Provisioning Technology in accordance with the Specification.
By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and making
it available in accordance with the Specification, you further
acknowledge your agreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary
rights to permit the following:
A series of actions may occur (&quot;Provisioning Process&quot;) in which
a user may execute the Provisioning Technology on a machine (&quot;Target
Machine&quot;) with the intent of installing, extending or updating
the functionality of an Eclipse-based product. 
During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology
may cause third party Installable Software or a portion thereof
to be accessed and copied to the Target Machine. 
Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the
terms and conditions that govern the use of the Installable Software
(&quot;Installable Software Agreement&quot;) and such Installable Software
Agreement shall be accessed from the Target Machine in accordance
with the Specification. Such Installable Software Agreement must
inform the user of the terms and conditions that govern the Installable
Software and must solicit acceptance by the end user in the manner
prescribed in such Installable Software Agreement. Upon such
indication of agreement by the user, the provisioning Technology
will complete installation of the Installable Software. 
Cryptography
Content may contain encryption software. The country in which
you are currently may have restrictions on the import, possession,
and use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software.
BEFORE using any encryption software, please check the country&apos;s
